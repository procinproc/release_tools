Keyword addition / extension tool

When you release software, you will be required to insert text such as
copyright and license into each source file. 
There are also texts that need to be updated with each release, such
as the version number. 
This software saves you the trouble of inserting text in the source
file. 

For example, suppose you are creating the following file called hello.c.

    #include <stdio.h>
    main ()
    {
        priintf ("hello, world \ n");
    }


Prepare test.conf, for example, with the following contents to display
the copyright. 

    license HALLO_LICENSE This is hallo license. \
       you can use this.
    copyright RIKEN_COPYRIGHT Copyright% y RIKEN.
    copyright2 RCCSPYRIGHT Copyright% y RIKEN R-CCS.
    version HELLO_VERSION 0.2


here

    $ add_keyword -config test -tag license, copyright, version hello.c


When you execute, the contents of hello.c will be the follwoing;

    / *
     * $ HALLO_LICENSE: $
     * $ RIKEN_COPYRIGHT: $
     * $ HELLO_VERSION: $
     * /
    #include <stdio.h>
    main ()
    {
        priintf ("hello, world \ n");
    }


To put license and copyright

    $ expand_keyword -config test -tag license, copyright hello.c


and you will get;

    / *
     * $ HALLO_LICENSE: This is hallo license.
     * you can use this. $
     * $ RIKEN_COPYRIGHT: Copyright 2013 RIKEN. $
     * $ HELLO_VERSION: $
     * /
    #include <stdio.h>
    main ()
    {
        priintf ("hello, world \ n");
    }

When releasing version0.1

    $ expand_keyword -config test -tag license, copyright, version hello.c


You will get;

    / *
     * $ HALLO_LICENSE: This is hallo license.
     * you can use this. $
     * $ RIKEN_COPYRIGHT: Copyright 2013 RIKEN. $
     * $ HELLO_VERSION: 0.1 $
     * /
    #include <stdio.h>
    main ()
    {
        priintf ("hello, world \ n");
    }


When releasing version 0,2, put the version line in test.config

    version HELLO_VERSION 0.2


Change to and again

    $ expand_keyword -config test -tag license, copyright, version hello.c


To run. If this command is run in 2014, you will get;

    / *
     * $ HALLO_LICENSE: This is hallo license.
     * you can use this. $
     * $ RIKEN_COPYRIGHT: Copyright 2013-2014 RIKEN. $
     * $ HELLO_VERSION: 0.2 $
     * /
    #include <stdio.h>
    main ()
    {
        priintf ("hello, world \ n");
    }
